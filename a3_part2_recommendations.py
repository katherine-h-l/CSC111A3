"""CSC111 Winter 2021 Assignment 3: Graphs, Recommender Systems, and Clustering (Part 2)

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains new classes to represent *weighted graphs and vertices*,
which we'll use to represent a book review network with scores of reviews as well.
This file is structured very similarly to a3_part1.py.
